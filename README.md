### The Columbia [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/) and [Columbia Enterpreneuship](http://entrepreneurship.columbia.edu/) are organizing the Second Week-long Intensive Data Science Boot Camp

- **When**: January 8th – 12th, 2018
- **Where**: Columbia Entrepreneurship Design Studio, Room 430 of the Riverside Church (490 Riverside Dr, New York, NY 10027)
- **Daily schedule**: 10am to 4pm (*9am to 10am, Introduction Monday, January 8th)
- **Who should apply**: PhD students and postdoctoral scholars who have working knowledge of programming and data analytics and are ready to sharpen their skills to include a training in data science.

The [Collaboratory@Columbia](http://collaboratory.columbia.edu/) is pleased to announce our second annual free  Data Science Bootcamp coming up over the winter break.  This week-long, immersive, hands-on workshop  is especially designed for Columbia University PhD students and postdoctoral scholars who are interested in extending their existing mathematical and programming skills to include a training in data science. Faculty may apply. Designed by faculty and postdoctoral scholars from Columbia University’s [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/), the curriculum includes on-line learning material, introductory lectures, hands-on laboratory experiences and a capstone project.

**[Andreas Mueller](http://amueller.github.io/)** ([@amueller](https://github.com/amueller)) is a lecturer at the [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/)at Columbia University and author of the O’Reilly book “[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://amueller.github.io/#book)”, describing a practical approach to machine learning with python and scikit-learn. He is one of the core developers of the scikit-learn machine learning library, and he has been co-maintaining it for several years. He is also a [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) instructor. In the past, he worked at the NYU Center for Data Science on open source and open science, and as Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon. You can find his full  cv [here](http://amueller.github.io/cv_andreas_mueller.pdf). His mission is to create open tools to lower the barrier of entry for machine learning applications, promote reproducible science and democratize the access to high-quality machine learning algorithms.

**[Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/)** ([@tz33cu](https://github.com/tz33cu)) is Professor of Statistics, Associate Director for Education of Data Science Institute at Columbia University. She develops novel methods for exploring and understanding patterns in complex data from different application domains such as biology, psychology, climatology, and etc. Her current projects are in the fields of statistical machine learning, spatiotemporal modeling and social network analysis. Professor Zheng’s research has been recognized by the 2008 Outstanding Statistical Application Award from the American Statistical Association (ASA), the Mitchell Prize from ISBA and a Google research award. She became a Fellow of American Statistical Association in 2014. Professor Zheng is the receipt of 2017 Columbia’s Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching. In 2018, she will be the chair-elect for ASA’s section on Statistical Learning and Data Science. She is on the advisory board for STATS at Sense About Science America that targets to develop a statistical literate citizenry.
